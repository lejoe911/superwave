# 2. Integrating a domain into Superwave

Superwave offers an automated way to integrate your domains into our DNS.

Simply visit [our domain onboarding platform](http://drop.superwave.ai) with the login provided to you in the Slack channel to get started (If you don’t have one yet, request one at your earliest convenience).

### Steps:

1. First, you will input your login to gain access:\

2. Then, you will upload your _.csv_ file and put your name. The name used must match the name in our logs or it will be rejected.

3. Here’s how your .csv file must look:

3. If you did it properly, your domain(s) should return the nameservers you need to install in your domain management panel.

### The system will not integrate _.csv_ files with the following:

* Anything with "https://" or "http://" or "www.".
* Domains with unnecessary spaces or bad spelling like “.cmo” or “.nett”
* More than ten (10) domains! Technically it can do more but you’re not the only one dropping domains so no more than ten domains per hour and per client due to Cloudflare’s API throttling.

### DNS records

The system automatically generates and stamps domain-personalized DMARC, DKIM records in addition to email tracking records for ESPs like **Smartlead**.

### Do you know how to install nameservers?

No matter where you buy your domains from, there is a panel in which you can swap your domain registrar’s nameservers (such as Namecheap’s or Porkbun’s) for the Cloudflare nameservers Superwave runs on.

Since each client has a different experience, you’re going to Google how to do it for your own registrar (You can ping us on Slack if you tried hard and couldn’t figure it out regardless).

### First come, first serve:

The system will put submitted domains in a queue and we will service them on an arrival basis.
