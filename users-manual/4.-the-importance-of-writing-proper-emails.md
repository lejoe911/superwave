# 4. The importance of writing proper emails

**Spam.**

You’re one crappy email away from destroying a campaign.

With Superwave, this is only a temporary nuisance. With every other email sending infrastructure provider, it’s almost permanent (Good luck rewarming for another 90 days).

Our datacenter allocation uses the highest-quality whitelisted Microsoft IP ranges no one outside Microsoft can get. This means that the domain reputation dance is already danced for you and the months of warmup (90 days to be exact) are already done for you almost magically on day one.

Does this mean you can disable warmup entirely and let it rip with the most aggressive emails known to the industry?

**Absolutely not.**

Low effort copywriting and aggressive sending ends up in this:

This means that even with the finest IP quality, most scalable sending architecture (i.e. Superwave) email platforms can spot a spammy email from a thousand miles away in record time.

### Why spintax matters:

```jsx
SUBJECT: {firstName}}, This email {{shouldn't| should not}} be in your inbox.

BODY:

{{Hey|Hi|Hello|What's up}} {{firstName}},

If you're reading {{this|this email}} then you're part of the {{5,000|five thousand}} business {{owners|executives}} that are chosen to unlock the profitable {{traffic|exposure}} levels of {{six figures in Facebook ads|six figures in YouTube ads}} at a fraction of {{the price|the cost}}.

The system built on {{"Microsoft for Startups"| "Microsoft Startups"}} {{tech|technology}} guarantees {{businesses|biznesses}} like {{companyName}} a 75%+ exposure rate for your {{marketing|business promotion}} campaigns with {{no preparation or costs|zero prepping and costs]} necessary on day 1 of launch.

We expect to make thousands of dollars from this {{simple email|single email}} and if you're {{interested|down}}, yours could be the next {{business|biz}} to {{97x|96×}} their client pipeline {{this year|in 2023}}.

Our top {{beta tester|client}}, {{The Chungus Group|The Chungus Group|Chungus Group|Chungus Group}} from {{Wyoming|Australia}} just cleared over {{50k|fifty thousand}} dollars {{a little bit more than a week ago|in march}}.

Let me know if this sounds profitable to you with a simple reply, otherwise feel free {{to ignore this email|reply with 'not interested'|pass on this}}.

{{Best|Thanks Thanks a lot}},

{{sendingAccountName}}
```

This is a generously spintaxed email. Notice that it includes both \{{firstName\}} and \{{Company\}} personalization and multiple iterations of the same sales message.

It is crucial for you to implement spintax. Email platforms do not blacklist “words” (At least with Superwave). Instead, they blacklist repetitive sentences. This means repeated sentences and word sequences will be picked up as **bulk email** which is what will send your entire campaign to the spam folder for at least 3 hours to up to 2 weeks.

Generous spintax refers to the use of multiple variations of a word or phrase in an email. This technique not only makes your email unique but also helps to avoid spam filters. By using spintax, you can ensure that your message is not detected as spam and lands in the recipient's inbox.

Complete personalization involves addressing the recipient by their name and mentioning their company in the email. This personal touch demonstrates that you have taken the time to research the recipient and are genuinely interested in connecting with them. It also helps to establish a connection with the recipient and makes them more likely to respond to your email.

### Convoluted email signatures count as spam:

Sounds ridiculous, but a signature like this example…

```jsx
Bob M. Jones | Sales Development Representative @ Cornball Inc.
LinkedIn.com/bobby
Book a call: Calendly.com/bobby
(307) 300.0001
21 Spam Rd. Cringetown WY 82801
```

is also interpreted as a pattern by spam filters, so make sure to trim a signature or spintax it heavily. With email, less is always more.

### Summary:

Even with the greatest offer in your industry and the most compelling copywriting, your email efforts will fall flat if they are not spintaxed.

You must remember that cold outreach is frowned upon by the big guys at Outlook, Gmail, Zoho and basically almost all of the market share holders in the email industry. Thus, you must abide by their rules, their biggest rule being “Don’t send crappy emails” (Refer to chapter 1 of this manual).
