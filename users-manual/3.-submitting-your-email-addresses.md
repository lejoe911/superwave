# 3. Submitting your email addresses

Observe the following **.csv** file:

This is how your custom name sheet should look. Notice the **lack of spaces in the column headers**. This is by design so the Superwave code can read it and produce your accounts.

### Prerequisites:

* You need to go to [Email Permutator: Find Anyone Email Address for Free (mailmeteor.com)](https://mailmeteor.com/email-permutator) and generate up to 99 versions of your names. If you are splitting it between three “Sales persons” you only need 33 for each. (Tip: If you need more variations, you can remove one or two letters from the first name, last name in different instances to have more combinations of the name in question).
* The custom name spreadsheet should be structured like in the image above. Remember, no spaces in the header titles so the code can read it.
* You need to refit the data to your senders bulk upload sheet. This means you have to manually copy paste the info into the sheet of your provider, like Smartlead. **This is very important or else you won’t be able to upload your accounts. If you don’t know what is your sending platform’s upload sheet, read their manual or documentation.**

### Features:

* No need to create a password as the code will create it for you.
* You can now have a single “Sales person” up to 99 times.
* You can also split the 99 users into multiple people if you wish (Ricky, Hannah, Ashley, whatever you want).

### **Limitations:**

* Some names aren’t able to produce 99 combinations of itself (Example: Bob only has 3 possible mathematical combinations). This means you either have to pick up another name, or request numbers to be added to the iterations.
* You can’t have the same address 99 times (Example: _tommy@domain_ can’t exist 99 times, but _t@domain, tom@domain, tommy@domain_, etc can)

### Submitting your custom names:

* Simply leave a Google Sheets link or the file itself in your assigned channel for us to fulfill once you integrated the domain in question (See chapter number two).

### Bonus: Creating female SDRs

It is well-known in this industry that women get higher open rates and more positive reception from niches and markets.

If you visit [this Google Colab script runner](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16qEkncssjxK\_IjsKkZAnV2j2wdhKQydn?usp=sharing) you can generate up to 99 female names in the proper format for your convenience. The script uses a database of thousands of girl names and a wide range of last names from all corners of the world so not two addresses are the same.

Once the script is ran, you'll be able to download your list this way by clicking on the three dots next to the .csv file with your domain as filename:

Your new **.csv** file is ready to be submitted to Superwave.
