# 6. Sending schedules

The following table applies to a single sending domain, with a single email campaign on a normal business day, assuming you send for eight hours per day from 9 AM to 5 PM:

| Warmup emails | Outreach emails | Total emails per hour | Total emails per day |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| 49            | 50              | 99                    | 792                  |

Those 49 warmup emails serve to sustain the day-one perfect reputation given to you by Superwave and to heal any bad email practices you might generate during a campaign.

The other 50 outreach emails are your normal sales sequences.

In total, a single domain will send 792 emails per day. That’s 1980% the sending firepower of a traditional cold emailing strategy.

### The 1:1 rule:

The outreach emails must always mirror the warmup emails to keep the deliverability clean and not risk losing reputation by outside forces neither you as a marketer nor us as a provider can control.

We can’t control people ignoring you, marking you as spam or getting hit with bounce errors because you didn’t clean your email list and you sent to broken addresses, but we can control the restoration of your domain’s reputation, that’s why we recommend this warmup setup:

It’s an aggressive warming setup, which is by design. This means your domain will artificially cause a spam flag so it can fix it immediately with it’s own warmup pool (The warmup pool marks your emails as not spam so you don’t risk it with real leads).
