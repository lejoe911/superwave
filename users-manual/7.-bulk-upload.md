# 7. Bulk upload

As of 2023, Microsoft has phased out the mechanism that made bulk upload possible: TLS.

It was first announced in 2018, paused in 2020, and then enforced in 2021 until now. In 2023, almost all Microsoft accounts worldwide have had their TLS mechanisms disabled in favor of the better, more secure OAuth.

### What is OAuth?

OAuth is, for the end user, the screen (Like the one above) in which you pick an account to log ing. It does not use your raw plaintext password but instead uses authentication keys and other things.

Unfortunately, thereâ€™s no way to easily bulk perform OAuth logins.

### Alternatives for users with more programming experience:

Selenium, [Axiom.ai](http://axiom.ai) and macros have shown to work properly. Since Superwave user sheets have the same password for your convenience, it should be easy to automate it.

### Alternatives for users with an army of VAs:

Just get them to log into each account. Takes 2 minutes per account.
